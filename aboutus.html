        <h3>
            <p>
            The Temecula Valley Computer User Group, a 501(C)(3) not-for-profit corporation, was organized to promote, sponsor and carry out educational and scientific efforts to further the understanding and knowledge of personal computing by the general public.
            <br>
            Our youth must be computer literate to compete in the society of today and the future.  Many of our adults need more understanding of the personal computer in their daily work places, and our seniors find they need the personal computer to adequately communicate with their friends and family members.
            <br>
            Our user group members help each other in solving each other's computer problems.  New members, beginners and guests are always welcome at our meetings.
